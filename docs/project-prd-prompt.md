I want to create a little web app called "PulsePoint" that takes my entire GitHub team's usage, combines it with their slack, Linear and Notion history, and creates a break down of their contributions over the past 1, 3, and 6 months.



Things i'm interested in:

- Git Code Contributions

- GitHub PR Activity

- Notion and Linear Activity

- Active Hours of the day over a given Sydney 7 day week

- Biggest areas of impact/contribution in plain english

- Observed Strengths and Potential Coaching Areas

  - Communication

  - Code Contributions

  - Mentoring/Commenting and peer feedback Contributions

  - Linear contributions, including level of clarity in requirements and stories

  - Notion contributions and activity.

- Slack activity

  - most active channels

  - peak hours

  - most mentioned by



- Potential 1:1 actions for their manager to mention



Browsing:

- Top contributors by time period

- Browsing support



Loading:

- Background loading via open APIs using my personal OAuth



Built using:

- Node.js

- Jest Unit testing

- tailwind CSS



Can you help me draft a PRD for use by Gemini and Cursor to create this app, including information required to build this.
