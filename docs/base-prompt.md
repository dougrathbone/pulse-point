@index.js You're helping me work on a performance tracking tool for my team. The details can be found at @project-guide.md

You also have a file @project-plan.md that is YOUR file. You can edit it, update is, and mark things off. Please read it to understand where you're up to and to keep a diary of your changes.

Some of the key files for context are:

@index.tsx The main javascript file for the project
@settings.js where all settings are stored. Make sure to store any key settings in this file.

Today we're going to work on:
- Initial build out of the app
- Slack integration and analysis
- GitHub integration and analysis
- Summary reporting of team performance through the app
