Okay, let's add the project structure and execution details to the PRD. We'll also address the `node ./index.tsx` requirement, clarifying how TypeScript projects are typically run.

**Added Sections/Refinements to PRD: PulsePoint**

*(Incorporating project structure and execution details)*

**6. Technical Specifications**

* **Backend Framework:** Node.js (using a framework like Express.js is recommended)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Frontend Framework:** React
* **Testing Framework:** Jest (for unit and potentially integration tests)
* **Frontend Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **API Client Libraries:** Use official or well-maintained libraries for interacting with GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Notion APIs (e.g., Octokit for GitHub, Bolt for Slack).
* **Core Logic:**
    * Identify team members by fetching members of a configured **GitHub Organization**.
    * Fetch relevant activity data (commits, PRs, etc.) for repositories within that organization, filtering by the identified members.
    * Associate GitHub user activity with other services (Slack, Linear, Notion) by matching **email addresses** retrieved from GitHub user profiles (requires appropriate permissions/scopes for the GitHub token) against user emails in other services.
* **Background Jobs:** Use `node-cron` for scheduling periodic background data fetching tasks (e.g., refreshing organization members, fetching daily activity).
* **Data Storage:** Flat-file system (e.g., JSON files) for storing application data, potentially including cached organization members, fetched activity, and correlation results. Organize files logically (e.g., by organization, by data source, by date range).
* **Deployment:** (To be decided - e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Google Cloud) Needs environment variable management for API keys/secrets. Ensure the deployment environment supports Node.js and can handle persistent file storage if needed, or consider strategies for statelessness if files are generated on-the-fly or stored externally (like S3).

**6.2. Execution**

* **Development:** To handle TypeScript compilation and execution easily during development, use a tool like `tsx`:
    * Install `tsx`: `npm install --save-dev tsx`
    * Add a script to `package.json`: `"dev": "tsx watch ./src/server/index.ts"` (or your chosen server entry point). The `watch` flag enables hot-reloading on changes.
    * Run using: `npm run dev`
* **Production Build & Run:** For production, it's standard practice to compile TypeScript to JavaScript first:
    * Compile: Use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). Add a script to `package.json`: `"build": "tsc"`
    * Run: Execute the compiled JavaScript entry point using Node.js. Add a script to `package.json`: `"start": "node ./dist/server/index.js"` (assuming `tsc` outputs to a `./dist` directory as configured in `tsconfig.json`).
    * Run using: `npm run build` then `npm start`.

* **Note on `node ./index.tsx`:** Node.js cannot directly execute `.ts` or `.tsx` files. The command `node ./index.tsx` would result in an error.
    * `.tsx` files contain JSX syntax specific to React and need transpilation.
    * The entry point for a Node.js backend server is typically a `.ts` file (like `src/server/index.ts`).
    * The development command `npm run dev` (using `tsx`) provides the simplest way to run the TypeScript server code directly during development. The production commands (`npm run build` and `npm start`) represent the standard deployment workflow.

**7. Testing**

* Test files will reside in the `/tests` directory.
* Jest (`jest.config.js`) should be configured to find and run tests within `/tests`.
* Test files should follow a naming convention like `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`.
* Add a script to `package.json` for running tests: `"test": "jest"` or `"test": "jest --watch"` for interactive testing during development.
