Okay, let's add the project structure and execution details to the PRD. We'll also address the `node ./index.tsx` requirement, clarifying how TypeScript projects are typically run.

**Added Sections/Refinements to PRD: PulsePoint**

*(Incorporating project structure and execution details)*

**6. Technical Specifications**

* **Backend Framework:** Node.js (using a framework like Express.js is recommended)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Frontend Framework:** React
* **Testing Framework:** Jest (for unit and potentially integration tests)
* **Frontend Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **API Client Libraries:** Use official or well-maintained libraries for interacting with GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Notion APIs (e.g., Octokit for GitHub, Bolt for Slack).
* **Configuration:**
    * **Secrets (`.env`):** API keys (GitHub PAT, Slack, Claude) are stored in a root `.env` file (ignored by git).
    * **Settings (`settings.ts`):** Non-secret config like the target GitHub Organization (`TARGET_ORG`) and optionally specific repositories (`TARGET_REPOS`) are set in `settings.ts` at the project root.
* **Core Logic:**
    * Identifies team members by fetching members (incl. name) of the `TARGET_ORG`.
    * Fetches relevant activity data (commits authored, PRs authored, Issues authored, PR comments made) for these members across specified/all org repos.
    * Calculates basic metrics like PR turnaround time (created to close).
    * Handles GitHub SAML SSO and Rate Limit errors gracefully, including serving stale cache data when available.
    * (Future) Associate GitHub user activity via email matching.
* **Caching:**
    * Uses a simple flat-file JSON cache (`.cache/github/`) for GitHub API results (org members, repos, aggregated/user activity) with configurable TTLs.
    * Includes a "serve stale on error" mechanism: if fetching fresh data fails (e.g., due to rate limits), it attempts to return the last known cached version, marking it as stale in the API response.
    * The cache directory is ignored by git.
* **Background Jobs:** (Not yet implemented) Use `node-cron` for scheduling periodic background data fetching tasks.
* **Data Storage:** Currently uses the file system cache. No persistent database is implemented yet.
* **Deployment:** (To be decided - e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Google Cloud) Needs environment variable management for API keys/secrets. Ensure the deployment environment supports Node.js and can handle persistent file storage if needed, or consider strategies for statelessness if files are generated on-the-fly or stored externally (like S3).

**6.2. Execution**

* **Development:** To handle TypeScript compilation and execution easily during development, use a tool like `tsx`:
    * Install `tsx`: `npm install --save-dev tsx`
    * Add a script to `package.json`: `"dev": "tsx watch ./src/server/index.ts"` (or your chosen server entry point). The `watch` flag enables hot-reloading on changes.
    * Run using: `npm run dev`
* **Production Build & Run:** For production, it's standard practice to compile TypeScript to JavaScript first:
    * Compile: Use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). Add a script to `package.json`: `"build": "tsc"`
    * Run: Execute the compiled JavaScript entry point using Node.js. Add a script to `package.json`: `"start": "node ./dist/server/index.js"` (assuming `tsc` outputs to a `./dist` directory as configured in `tsconfig.json`).
    * Run using: `npm run build` then `npm start`.

* **Note on `node ./index.tsx`:** Node.js cannot directly execute `.ts` or `.tsx` files. The command `node ./index.tsx` would result in an error.
    * `.tsx` files contain JSX syntax specific to React and need transpilation.
    * The entry point for a Node.js backend server is typically a `.ts` file (like `src/server/index.ts`).
    * The development command `npm run dev` (using `tsx`) provides the simplest way to run the TypeScript server code directly during development. The production commands (`npm run build` and `npm start`) represent the standard deployment workflow.

**7. Testing**

* Test files will reside in the `/tests` directory.
* Jest (`jest.config.js`) should be configured to find and run tests within `/tests`.
* Test files should follow a naming convention like `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`.
* Add a script to `package.json`
