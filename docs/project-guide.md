Okay, let's add the project structure and execution details to the PRD. We'll also address the `node ./index.tsx` requirement, clarifying how TypeScript projects are typically run.

**Added Sections/Refinements to PRD: PulsePoint**

*(Incorporating project structure and execution details)*

**6. Technical Specifications**

* **Backend Framework:** Node.js (using a framework like Express.js is recommended)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Frontend Framework:** React
* **Testing Framework:** Jest (for unit and potentially integration tests)
* **Frontend Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **API Client Libraries:** Use official or well-maintained libraries for interacting with GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Notion APIs (e.g., `axios` or `node-fetch` for direct calls, or specific SDKs if available).
* **Background Jobs:** Use `node-cron` for scheduling periodic background data fetching tasks.
* **Data Storage:** Flat-file system (e.g., JSON files) for storing application data. Consider organizing files logically (e.g., by user, by data source, by date range).
* **Deployment:** (To be decided - e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Google Cloud) Needs environment variable management for API keys/secrets. Ensure the deployment environment supports Node.js and can handle persistent file storage if needed, or consider strategies for statelessness if files are generated on-the-fly or stored externally (like S3).

**6.1. Project Structure**

The project repository should follow this basic directory structure:

```
pulsepoint/
├── /docs             # Documentation files (e.g., PRD, setup guides)
├── /src              # Source code files (TypeScript/TSX)
│   ├── /components   # React frontend components (.tsx)
│   ├── /server       # Backend Node.js code (.ts)
│   │   ├── /api      # API route handlers
│   │   ├── /services # Business logic, API clients
│   │   └── index.ts  # Server entry point (or server.ts)
│   ├── /shared       # Shared types or utilities (.ts)
│   └── index.tsx     # Frontend entry point (if applicable, for bundling)
├── /tests            # Test files (.test.ts or .spec.ts)
│   └── *.test.ts     # Jest test files, mirroring /src structure often helps
├── jest.config.js    # Jest configuration
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tailwind.config.js # Tailwind CSS configuration
├── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
└── .env              # Environment variables (should be in .gitignore)
```

**6.2. Execution**

* **Development:** To handle TypeScript compilation and execution easily during development, use a tool like `tsx`:
    * Install `tsx`: `npm install --save-dev tsx`
    * Add a script to `package.json`: `"dev": "tsx watch ./src/server/index.ts"` (or your chosen server entry point). The `watch` flag enables hot-reloading on changes.
    * Run using: `npm run dev`
* **Production Build & Run:** For production, it's standard practice to compile TypeScript to JavaScript first:
    * Compile: Use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). Add a script to `package.json`: `"build": "tsc"`
    * Run: Execute the compiled JavaScript entry point using Node.js. Add a script to `package.json`: `"start": "node ./dist/server/index.js"` (assuming `tsc` outputs to a `./dist` directory as configured in `tsconfig.json`).
    * Run using: `npm run build` then `npm start`.

* **Note on `node ./index.tsx`:** Node.js cannot directly execute `.ts` or `.tsx` files. The command `node ./index.tsx` would result in an error.
    * `.tsx` files contain JSX syntax specific to React and need transpilation.
    * The entry point for a Node.js backend server is typically a `.ts` file (like `src/server/index.ts`).
    * The development command `npm run dev` (using `tsx`) provides the simplest way to run the TypeScript server code directly during development. The production commands (`npm run build` and `npm start`) represent the standard deployment workflow.

**7. Testing**

* Test files will reside in the `/tests` directory.
* Jest (`jest.config.js`) should be configured to find and run tests within `/tests`.
* Test files should follow a naming convention like `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`.
* Add a script to `package.json` for running tests: `"test": "jest"` or `"test": "jest --watch"` for interactive testing during development.
